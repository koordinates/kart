# sno changelog

Please note that compatibility for 0.x releases (software or repositories) isn't guaranteed. Sno is evolving quickly and things will change. However, we aim to provide the means to upgrade existing repositories between 0.x versions and to 1.0.

_When adding new entries to the changelog, please include issue/PR numbers wherever possible._

## 0.7.0 (UNRELEASED)

 * Support for checking out a dataset with a string primary key (or other non-integer primary key) as a GPKG working copy [#307](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/307)
 * Bugfix - `sno meta set` didn't allow updates to `schema.json`
 * Bugfix - Fixed a potential `KeyError` in `Schema._try_align`
 * Bugfix - Fixed a potential `unexpected NoneType` in `WorkingCopy.is_dirty`
 * Bugfix - imports now preserve fixed-precision numeric types in most situations.
 * Bugfix - imports now preserve length of text/string fields.

## 0.6.0

### Major changes in this release

 * Newly created Sno repositories no longer have git internals visible in the main folder - they are hidden away in a '.sno' folder. [#147](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/147)
 * The working copy can now be a PostgreSQL / PostGIS database (previously only GPKG working copies were supported). The commands `init`, `clone` and `create-workingcopy` now all accept working copy paths in the form `postgresql://[HOST]/DBNAME/SCHEMA` [#267](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/267)
     - Read the documentation at `docs/POSTGIS_WC.md`
 * Patches that create or delete datasets are now supported in Datasets V2 [#239](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/239)

### Minor features / fixes:

 * `apply` and `import` no longer create empty commits unless you specify `--allow-empty` [#243](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/243), [#245](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/245)
 * `apply` can now apply patches to branches other than `HEAD` [#294](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/294)
 * `apply`, `commit` and `merge` commands now optimise repositories after committing, to avoid poor repo performance. [#250](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/250)
 * `commit` now checks that the diff to be committed matches the schema, and rejects diffs that do not - this is possible in working copy formats that have relatively lax type enforcement, ie GPKG [#300](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/pull/300)
 *  Added GPKG support for Sno types that GPKG doesn't support - they are approximated as strings. [#304](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/pull/304)
 *  `schema.json` no longer stores attributes that are null - a missing attribute has the same meaning as that attribute being present and null. [#304](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/pull/304)
 * `data ls` now accepts an optional ref argument
 * `meta get` now accepts a `--ref=REF` option
 * `clone` now accepts a `--branch` option to clone a specific branch.
 * `switch BRANCH` now switches to a newly created local branch that tracks `BRANCH`, if `BRANCH` is a remote branch and not a local branch [#259](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/259)
 * `gc` command added (delegates to `git gc`)
 * Bugfix - don't drop the user-supplied authority from the supplied CRS and generate a new unrelated one. [#278](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/278)
 * Bugfix - generated CRS numbers are now within the user range: 200000 to 209199 [#296](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/296)

## 0.5.0

Sno v0.5 introduces a new repo layout, which is the default, dubbed 'Datasets V2'

Existing commands are backward compatible with V1 datasets, however some new functionality is only supported in repositories upgraded to the new layout.


### Datasets V2

 * Entire repositories can be upgraded from V1 to V2 using `sno upgrade EXISTING_REPO NEW_REPO`.
 * V2 should support everything V1 supports
 * All new repositories use the new layout by default. To opt out, use the `--repo-version=1` flag for `sno init`
 * A future release will drop support for v1 repositories

#### New features for V2 repositories only

 * Most schema changes now work
     - this includes column adds, drops, renames and reordering.
     - Notably, changing the primary key field of a dataset are not yet supported.
 * Meta changes are now supported (title, description and XML metadata for each dataset)
 * `import` now has a `--replace-existing` flag to replace existing dataset(s).

#### Missing functionality in Datasets V2

 * String primary keys and tables without primary keys are not yet supported. [#212](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/212)
 * Changing the primary key column is not yet supported. [#238](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/238)
 * Patches which create or delete datasets are not supported. [#239](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/239)
 * Schema changes might not be correctly interpreted if too many changes are made at once (eg adding a new column with the same name as a deleted column - sno may incorrectly assume it is the same column).
    - It is safest to commit schema changes to any existing columns, then commit schema changes adding any new columns, then commit any feature changes.

### Breaking changes in this release

 * New structure to `sno diff` output:
    - Text output: Features are now labelled as `<dataset>:feature:<primary_key>`, consistent with meta items that are labelled as `<dataset>:meta:<meta_item_name>`
    - JSON output also uses "feature" and "meta" as keys for the different types of changes, instead of "featureChanges" and "metaChanges".
 * `sno show -o json` header key changed to `sno.show/v1`, which is not an applyable patch. Use `sno create-patch` to create a patch.
 * `sno upgrade` now only takes two arguments: `sno upgrade EXISTING_REPO NEW_REPO`. No other arguments are required or accepted, exactly how to upgrade the repository is detected automatically.

### Other changes in this release

 * Added `sno create-patch <refish>` - creates a JSON patch file, which can be applied using `sno apply` [#210](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/210)
 * Added `sno data ls` - shows a list of datasets in the sno repository [#203](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/203)
 * `sno help [command]` is a synonym for `sno [subcommand] --help` [#221](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/221)
 * `sno clone` now support shallow clones (`--depth N`) to avoid cloning a repo's entire history [#174](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/174)
 * `sno log` now supports JSON output with `--output-format json` [#170](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/170)
 * `sno meta get` now prints text items as text (not encoded as JSON) [#211](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/211)
 * `sno meta get` without arguments now outputs multiple datasets [#217](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/217)
 * `sno diff` and `sno show` now accept a `--crs` parameter to reproject output [#213](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/213)
 * Streaming diffs: less time until first change is shown when diffing large changes. [#156](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/156)
 * Working copies are now created automatically. [#192](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/192)
 * Commands which are misspelled now suggest the correct spelling [#199](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/199)
 * Bugfix: operations that should immediately fail due to dirty working copy no longer partially succeed. [#181](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/181)
 * Bugfix: some column datatype conversion issues during import and checkout.
 * Linux: Add openssh client dependency into rpm & deb packages. [#121](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/121)
 * Windows: Fix missing PROJ data files in packages. [#235](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/235)

## 0.4.1

* `import`: Added `--table-info` option to set dataset metadata, when it can't be autodetected from the source database ([#139](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/139))
* `pull`, `push`, `fetch`, `clone` commands now show progress - disabled with `--quiet` ([#144](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/144))
* `import` now works while on an empty branch ([#149](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/149))
