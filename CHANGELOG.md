# sno changelog

Please note that compatibility for 0.x releases (software or repositories) isn't guaranteed. Sno is evolving quickly and things will change. However, we aim to provide the means to upgrade existing repositories between 0.x versions and to 1.0.

_When adding new entries to the changelog, please include issue/PR numbers wherever possible._
