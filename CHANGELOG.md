# sno changelog

Please note that compatibility for 0.x releases (software or repositories) isn't guaranteed. Sno is evolving quickly and things will change. However, we aim to provide the means to upgrade existing repositories between 0.x versions and to 1.0.

_When adding new entries to the changelog, please include issue/PR numbers wherever possible._

## 0.5.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Breaking changes in this release

 * New structure to `sno diff` output:
    - Text output: Features are now labelled as `<dataset>:feature:<primary_key>`, consistent with meta items that are labelled as `<dataset>:meta:<meta_item_name>`
    - JSON output also uses "feature" and "meta" as keys for the different types of changes, instead of "featureChanges" and "metaChanges".
  * Meta changes are now included in `sno diff` output:
    - Eg title, description and schema changes.
    - This is true for Datasets V1 and for Datasets V2 (see below), but meta changes can only be committed in datasets V2.

### Major changes in this release

 * A new repository structure/layout, which supports schema changes. Internally known as Datasets V2.
    - Unlike Datasets V1, the schema can be modified without rewriting every row in a dataset.
    - However, new repositories are still V1 repositories unless V2 is explicitly requested, since V2 is still in development.
    - Tracking issue [#72](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/72)
    - Diffs, commits and patches all support meta changes
    - Working copy tracking tables have been renamed [#63](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/63)

#### Using Datasets V1

 * Unless specific action is taken, existing repositories will remain V1, and new repositories still default to V1.

#### Using Datasets V2

 * An entire repository must be either V1 or V2, so to use V2, all data must be imported as V2.
 * Data can be imported as V2 using `sno init --import=<data> --version=2` or `sno import <data> --version=2`
 * Entire repositories can be upgraded from V1 to V2 with `sno upgrade 02-05 <old_repo> <new_repo>`.
 * Most functionality from V1 is available in V2, but there may be some bugs.

#### Important missing functionality in Datasets V2

 * Geometry storage format is not yet finalised.
 * String primary keys and tables without primary keys are not yet supported.
 * Changing the primary key column is not yet fully supported.
 * Schema changes might not be correctly interpreted if too many changes are made at once.
    - It is safest to commit changes to any existing columns, then commit any new columns, then commit any feature changes.

### Other changes in this release

 * Added `sno create-patch <refish>` - creates a JSON patch file, which can be applied using `sno apply` [#210](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/210)
 * `sno clone` now support shallow clones (`--depth N`) to avoid cloning a repo's entire history [#174](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/174)
 * `sno log` now supports JSON output with `--output-format json` [#170](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/170)
 * `sno meta get` now prints text items as text (not encoded as JSON) [#211](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/211)
 * Streaming diffs: less time until first change is shown when diffing large changes. [#156](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/156)
 * Working copies are now created automatically. [#192](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/192)
 * Commands which are misspelled now suggest the correct spelling [#199](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/199)
 * Bugfix: operations that should immediately fail due to dirty working copy no longer partially succeed. [#181](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/181)
 * Bugfix: some column datatype conversion issues during import and checkout.

## 0.4.1

### Packaging fix:

* packaging: Fix issue with broken git component paths in packages on macOS and Linux ([#143](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/143))

* `import`: Added `--table-info` option to set dataset metadata, when it can't be autodetected from the source database ([#139](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/139))
* `pull`, `push`, `fetch`, `clone` commands now show progress - disabled with `--quiet` ([#144](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/144))
* `import` now works while on an empty branch ([#149](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/149))

## 0.4.0

### Major changes in this release

* Basic conflict resolution:
    - `sno merge` now puts the repo in a merging state when there are conflicts ([#80](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/80))
    - Added `sno conflicts` to list conflicts ([#84](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/84))

    - Can now import from postgres databases ([#90](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/90))
    - Multiple tables can be imported at once ([#118](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/118))
* Added `sno show`: shows a commit. With `-o json` generates a patch ([#48](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/48))

    - GPKG database paths no longer need `GPKG:` prefix
    - now takes table names as separate arguments
    - Added `--primary-key=FIELD` to override primary key field name
    - Added `--message` to customize the commit message
    - `--list` no longer requires a repository

    - Added JSON output option for most commands
    - Added `--json-style` option to several commands to control JSON formatting ([#70](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/70))
* `sno diff`:
    - `a..b` now refers to the same changes as `sno log a..b` ([#116](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/116))
    - can now diff against tree objects, particularly the empty tree ([#53](https://github.com/koordinates/sno/issues/53))
