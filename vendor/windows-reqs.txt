# Python windows wheels, sourced from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
# Install via `nmake /F makefile.vc pipwin-refresh`.
# Note that pipwin pretty aggressively removes old versions.

# By default, we look to download a zip-file of the form:
# https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build-artifacts.sno.earth/vendor/windows-wheels/sno-windows-vendor-wheels-{SHA1}.zip
# where {SHA1} is the SHA1 of this file.
# Create it with `nmake /F makefile.vc wheelhouse-archive` once you've got all your versions/wheels in place.
