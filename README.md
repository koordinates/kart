> ```console
> $ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
> $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
> ```

#### Quick Start

1. Export a GeoPackage from [Koordinates](https://koordinates.com/) with any combination of vector layers and tables.
2. Create a new Sno repository and import the GeoPackage (eg. `kx-foo-layer.gpkg`).
   ```console
   $ sno init myproject --import GPKG:kx-foo-layer.gpkg
   $ cd myproject
   ```
   Use this repository as the directory to run all the other commands in.
   This will also create a working copy as `myproject/myproject.gpkg` to edit.
4. Editing the working copy in QGIS/etc:
   * will track changes in the internal `.sno-*` tables
   * additions/edits/deletes of features are supported
   * changing feature PKs is supported
   * schema changes should be detected, but aren't supported yet (will error).
   * Use F5 to refresh your QGIS map after changing the underlying working-copy data using `sno`.
5. With your working copy, `sno` commands should work if run from the `myproject/` folder. Check `--help` for options, the most important ones are supported. In some cases options are passed straight through to an underlying git command:
    * `sno diff` diff the working copy against the repository (no index!)
    * `sno commit -m {message}` commit outstanding changes from the working copy
    * `sno log` review commit history
    * `sno branch` & `sno checkout -b` branch management
    * `sno fetch` fetch upstream changes.
    * `sno status` show working copy state.
    * `sno merge` merge. Supports `--ff`/`--no-ff`/`--ff-only` from one merge source.
    * `sno switch` switch to existing or new branches.
    * `sno reset` & `sno restore` discard changes in the working copy.
    * `sno tag ...`
    * `sno remote ...`. Remember simple remotes can just be another local directory.
    * `sno push` / `sno pull`
    * `sno clone` initialise a new repository from a remote URL,
