Why Kart
========

-  **Built on Git, works like Git** - uses standard Git repositories and
   Git-like CLI commands. If you know Git, you'll feel right at home
   with Kart.
-  **Your choice of format** - supports Microsoft SQL Server,
   PostgreSQL/PostGIS, MySQL and GeoPackage, with more coming soon.
-  **Synchronize data** - accurately synchronize datasets between
   systems in seconds. Kart moves and applies a minimal compressed set
   of changes.
-  Interact directly from within `QGIS <https://qgis.org/>`_ with the `Kart Plugin <https://github.com/koordinates/kart-qgis-plugin/>`_.
-  `And much more... <https://kartproject.org/>`_


Project Status
--------------
