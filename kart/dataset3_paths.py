class PathEncoder:
    """
    A system for transforming a primary key to a path (which can be transformed back into a primary key again).
    The path structure attempts to spread out features so that every tree has at most a relatively small number
    of children, so that neighbouring primary keys also tend to be neighbours in trees, and so that small datasets
    have few trees. This is achieved by placing features in a nested structure of a few levels of trees, such that
    a low branch factor can still branch out into millions of features.

    - A dataset with a single integer primary key will get encoded with 4 tree levels and a branch factor of 64 at each
      level. Sequential PKs tend to end up in the same tree.
    - Anything else (multiple PK fields, strings, etc) gets the PKs values hashed first, before encoding into a similar
      64-branch 4-level structure.

    Before 0.10, Kart used a two-level, 256-branch structure and hashed *all* PKs first. However, this system proved
    costly for massive repos (roughly, repos with greater than 16 milllion features), resulting in significant
    repository bloat. Existing repos created before this change (Datasets V2 repos) continue to use the old system,
    which Kart continues to support.
