# - make sure long polygon edges are segmented into short lines before reprojecting, so that the
# geographical location of the middle of the polygon's edge doesn't change
# - handle anti-meridians appropriately, particularly the case where the spatial filter crosses the anti-meridian
# - handle the case where the spatial filter cannot or can only partially be projected to the target CRS
